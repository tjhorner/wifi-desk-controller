# WiFi Desk Controller

This repository includes the source files for my WiFi Desk Controller design.

- `firmware`: The stock ESPHome-based firmware that's available from the GitHub Releases and [my website](https://shop.horner.tj/things/desk-controller/config)
- `enclosure`: Fusion 360 source, STL, and STEP files for the 3D-printable enclosure
- `pcb`: KiCad project files for the PCB

You may also find the associated [ESPHome custom component](https://github.com/tjhorner/esphome-standing-desk) interesting if you want to implement your own desk brand, or just dive deeper into how the firmware works.

## License

The ESPHome configs are licensed under MIT; everything else (enclosure and PCB design) are CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. The appropriate license files are available in the root of the repo.
